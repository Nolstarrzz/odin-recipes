    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An oatmeal raisin cookie is a type of drop cookie made 
        from an oatmeal-based dough with raisins. Its ingredients also 
        typically include flour, sugar, eggs, salt, and spices.
    </p>
        When the cookies were becoming prominent in the 
        United States in the early 1900s,
        they came to be known as a health food because 
        of the fiber and vitamins from the oatmeal and raisins.
