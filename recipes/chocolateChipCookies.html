    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips 
        or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States in 1938, 
        when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar 
        and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.
